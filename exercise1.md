In C++, Visual Studio has many features that include linting, testing, and building C++ code. Linting can be used in their IDE, testing can be done via Test Explorer, and building the application can be done in the IDE as well. Other CI alternatives, like GitLab and Bamboo, work as well. These alternatives have options where you can host the server on their cloud services or on the workplace premises. There are also free versions or plans for some of these services. For a group of six people, I believe that having a cloud-based environment would be better. I do not know what kind of program they are producing, but it is a safe guess to say that the program can't be so complex that it requires a self-hosted environment. In addition, having a cloud-based environment would be much less expensive than hosting it locally. I believe this is ideal for a smaller team, as they typically do not have the budget to build their own hardware for this solution. In addition, with a team of six people, there might not be pushes to the branches all the time. As such, cloud-based solutions usually save you money by scaling up their servers to meet your changing frequency.
